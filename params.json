I'm currently developing 2 projects: Terrestrial, a mod for Terraria, and Floatsound, an independent game.\r\nI'm 16 years old, and I really enjoy cookies. Not the cookies that websites create to save stuff, but actual cookies. They're great.\r\nI have a few friends here on Github: [Porocyon,](https://github.com/PoroCYon) who specialises in a lot more languages than me and is far more skilled, and [Vince,](https://github.com/Vincedenengel) who specialises in Java.\r\n### Why Github Pages?\r\nAt the moment, I'm unable to pay monthly money to a server, because I don't make any profit, and don't have a credit card.\r\nThis semt like the best alternative to me (rather, a friend told me about this) and it's very flexible.\r\n### In the end...\r\nThat's me. Anything else might be added later.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
